As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own.\n\nAnd just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another.\n\nGrape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region.\n\n\n\nYet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian.\n\nThe European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste.\n\nFor the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health.\n\nThe Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste.\n\n\n\nInteresting Facts about Georgian Wine:\n\n\n\tIn Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular.\n\tCeramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine.\n\tThe word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines.\n\tThe stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course).\n\tGeorgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine!\n\n\nWith wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.\n\nMore about Georgian wine:\n\nGeorgian Winemaking Technology\nTraditions of Georgian Wine\nGeorgian Wine Types            \n            \n                        \n                        \n        ","typeAnswerQuestions":false,"trueFalseQuestions":false}

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own.\n\nAnd just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another.\n\nGrape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region.\n\n\n\nYet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian.\n\nThe European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste.\n\nFor the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health.\n\nThe Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste.\n\n\n\nInteresting Facts about Georgian Wine:\n\n\n\tIn Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular.\n\tCeramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine.\n\tThe word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines.\n\tThe stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course).\n\tGeorgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine!\n\n\nWith wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.\n\nMore about Georgian wine:\n\nGeorgian Winemaking Technology\nTraditions of Georgian Wine\nGeorgian Wine Types            \n            \n                        \n                        \n        ","typeAnswerQuestions":false,"trueFalseQuestions":false}

The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine!

            The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc. ) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word "saperavi" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines.

Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs.

In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

Maui’s dolphins are facing extinction; there are now less than 50 individuals left living along a 22-mile stretch of coastline. The problem causing this rapid decline and indeed the decline of Hector’s dolphin (the other New Zealand dolphin sub-species) in South Island is entanglement in fishing nets.

They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile, joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities with humans. While most dolphins live in the ocean, some inhabit rivers and lakes. They all have their own unique identities and characteristics! Top ten facts about dolphins There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises. Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young. A dolphin pregnancy last between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew they food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing. All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240. The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest. The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America. Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills. Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas.

They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile, joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities with humans. While most dolphins live in the ocean, some inhabit rivers and lakes. They all have their own unique identities and characteristics! Top ten facts about dolphins There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises. Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young. A dolphin pregnancy last between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew they food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing. All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240. The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest. The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America. Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills. Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas. Maui's dolphin (a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin) is the most endangered dolphin. There are less than 50 individuals remaining. Fewer than 10 vaquitas (a species of porpoise) survive. More amazing facts about dolphins The smallest dolphins New Zealand dolphin0 metres (female) Tucuxi0 metres (female) Vaquita0 metres (female) Which is the world's most endangered dolphin?The vaquita, which in Spanish means ‘little cow’, is the smallest porpoise in the world, and also the most endangered. The vaquita lives only in Mexican coastal waters, in a small area of the northern Gulf of California. The species is in terrible trouble and facing imminent extinction; there are only about 30 individuals left. Accidental capture and death in fishing nets is the cause of their rapid decline in numbers; to put it simply, more vaquitas are killed in fishing nets than are born each year. Maui's dolphin is also on the brink of extinction. Maui’s dolphin is a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin that lives only in coastal waters of part of North Island, New Zealand. Maui’s dolphins are facing extinction; there are now less than 50 individuals left living along a 22-mile stretch of coastline. The problem causing this rapid decline and indeed the decline of Hector’s dolphin (the other New Zealand dolphin sub-species) in South Island is entanglement in fishing nets. Please help us save dolphins By adopting a whale or dolphin, by making a donation, or by fundraising for WDC, you can help us provide a safe future for these amazing creatures. Adopt Adopt a dolphin and help us protect these amazing creatures. Donate Your gifts help us take action for whales and dolphins.

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own.\n\nAnd just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another.\n\nGrape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region.\n\n\n\nYet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian.\n\nThe European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste.\n\nFor the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health.\n\nThe Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste.\n\n\n\nInteresting Facts about Georgian Wine:\n\n\n\tIn Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular.\n\tCeramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine.\n\tThe word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines.\n\tThe stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course).\n\tGeorgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine!\n\n\nWith wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.\n\nMore about Georgian wine:\n\nGeorgian Winemaking Technology\nTraditions of Georgian Wine\nGeorgian Wine Types            \n            \n                        \n                        \n        "}

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

They all have their own unique identities and characteristics! Top ten facts about dolphins There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises. Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young. A dolphin pregnancy last between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew they food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing. All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240. The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest. The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America. Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills. Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas.

They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile, joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities with humans. While most dolphins live in the ocean, some inhabit rivers and lakes. They all have their own unique identities and characteristics! Top ten facts about dolphins There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises. Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young. A dolphin pregnancy last between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew they food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing. All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240. The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest. The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America. Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills. Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas.

Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another.\n\nGrape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region.\n\n\n\nYet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian.\n\nThe European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste.\n\nFor the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health.\n\nThe Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste.\n\n\n\nInteresting Facts about Georgian Wine:\n\n\n\tIn Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular.\n\tCeramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine.\n\tThe word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines.\n\tThe stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course).\n\tGeorgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine!\n\n\nWith wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.\n\nMore about Georgian wine:\n\nGeorgian Winemaking Technology\nTraditions of Georgian Wine\nGeorgian Wine Types            \n            \n                        \n                        \n        "}

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel.

As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

Maui's dolphin is also on the brink of extinction. Maui’s dolphin is a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin that lives only in coastal waters of part of North Island, New Zealand. Maui’s dolphins are facing extinction; there are now less than 50 individuals left living along a 22-mile stretch of coastline. The problem causing this rapid decline and indeed the decline of Hector’s dolphin (the other New Zealand dolphin sub-species) in South Island is entanglement in fishing nets. Please help us save dolphins By adopting a whale or dolphin, by making a donation, or by fundraising for WDC, you can help us provide a safe future for these amazing creatures. Adopt Adopt a dolphin and help us protect these amazing creatures. Donate Your gifts help us take action for whales and dolphins.

2025-05-25 07:02:35,944 - app.api.middleware.logging - INFO - Request body: {"text":"Home GeorgiaWine “Georgian wines” is a phrase which may sound like a brand, for wine in Georgia is a brand, as well as an invaluable part of local culture and a vital sector of the Georgian economy. As Georgia and wine are inseparable, any travel guide will insist that tasting this drink when visiting is an absolute must. Wine itself is diverse - it may be red or white, sweet or acidic, strong or subtle, new or aged - but the uniqueness of Georgian wine sets it apart in a class entirely its own. And just what makes Georgian wines so special? Grapes, of course! Grape varieties have a huge impact on the taste of wine, which is why, for example, the wines of Argentina and France are so different from one another. Armenia’s extra sweet grapes produce strong, sweet wines, although such grapes are actually ideal for making cognac, not wine. Interestingly, even a specific grape variety will grow differently in different countries due to climate and topography. As an example, Saperavi wine from Georgia’s Kakheti Region and Saperavi wine produced from grapes grown elsewhere will be very different from one another. Grape varieties are divided into black and white according to the color of the skin, with Saperavi, Mtsvane, Chinuri, Rkatsiteli, Aleksandrouli and Tsolikauri among the most famous kinds in Georgia. In total there are 525 known endemic grape varieties in Georgia. Their uniqueness lies in the fact that they were not imported but have always grown here, first in the wild and then on cultivated lands, thus giving shape to centuries of Georgian wine history. In Georgia, grapes grow on the plains and in the foothills, with more than 75% of all Georgian grapes found in Kakheti Region. Yet Georgia’s unique and diverse grapes are not the only reason why Georgian wines differ from others. Georgia also employs special winemaking technologies, with the three main methods being European (classical), Kakhetian and Imeretian. The European or classical method involves storing the grapes in “satnakheli”,  large wooden containers made from peeled twigs. The grapes are then crushed with bare feet and the juice separated from the peels and seeds before fermentation. This method was used in ancient Greece and Rome and was first introduced to Georgia by Alexander Chavchavadze in the 19th century. Today it is also used in France and other countries which imitate the French method of wine production. The classical method results in a low-astringency wine with a very even taste. For the Kakhetian method of winemaking, the seeds and crushed grapes are not separated from the juice. Instead, all is placed together in a special ceramic vessel called qvevri, which is then buried for 3-6 months. The Kakhetian method often produces an orange or Georgian amber wine with a tart and full-bodied taste. Compared to European varieties, Kakhetian wines contain a higher percentage of antioxidants and polyphenols, both of which are beneficial to one’s health. The Imeretian method of winemaking combines European and Kakhetian techniques by adding 15-25% of the extracts (crushed grapes with seeds) to the kvevri vessels. This wine is distinguished by its higher acidity, lower astringency and smoother taste. Interesting Facts about Georgian Wine: In Georgia, wines may be produced either from one grape variety (Saperavi, Kindzmarauli, Akhasheni, Mtsvane, Rkatsiteli, Kisi, Usakhelouri, etc.) or by combining different varieties. For example, in Racha the famous Khvanchkara wine is made from Alexanduli and Mujuretuli varieties, white in Tsinandali the Rkatsiteli and Mtsvane grapes are often paired. In western Georgia an ensemble of three white grape varieties -Tsitska, Tsolikauri and Krakhuna - is popular. Ceramic qvevri vessels used to ferment Georgian wine are gradually being replaced with more practical metal vessels, an alteration which is affecting the flavor of the wine. The word \"saperavi\" means something with which to paint or to dye. Compared to the average red grape variety, the color of the saperavi grape is indeed intensely red and is known for producing one of the top 10 Georgian wines. The stronger the astringency of Georgian wine, the more polyphenols and tannins it contains and thus the more beneficial it is for your health (in reasonable quantities, of course). Georgian wines include many red, white, rose and amber varieties, yet contrary to popular belief the color of the wine does not depend on the color of the grape. Grape juice itself has no color, and the tint instead comes from the coloring substances in the peel. If the juice is separated from the pulp during the first fermentation, black-skinned grapes can actually produce white wine! With wine now a full-fledged attraction in Georgia, the popularity of wine tours has soared. The most popular destination for wine tours is, of course, Kakheti Region, which is known for its many wineries and diverse wine types. Wine tours are usually focused on either commercial or family wineries, yet a combo tour to both types of establishments is also possible. Wine tasting is a great way to get acquainted with famous local wines while soaking in Georgia’s natural and architectural beauty. September, when the grape harvest holiday of Rtveli takes place in Georgia, is the ideal month for a wine tour.

They are socially skilled, intelligent, agile, joyful, and playful creatures that share many emotional similarities with humans. While most dolphins live in the ocean, some inhabit rivers and lakes. They all have their own unique identities and characteristics! Top ten facts about dolphins There are currently 42 species of dolphins and seven species of porpoises. Dolphins are marine mammals. They must surface to breathe air and give birth to live young. A dolphin pregnancy last between nine and 16 months. The mother feeds her offspring on milk. The sons and daughters of resident orcas stay with their maternal family for life. Dolphins eat fish, squid and crustaceans. They do not chew they food but may break it into smaller pieces before swallowing. All dolphins have conical-shaped teeth. A Risso's dolphin has 14 while a spinner dolphin can have 240. The orca (killer whale) is the largest dolphin. Hector's dolphin and Franciscana are two of the smallest. The five river dolphin species inhabit the large waterways of Asia and South America. Dolphins have an array of vocalisations such as clicks, whistles and squeals which they use for their well-developed communication and echolocation skills. Lifespan varies from around 20 years in the smaller dolphin species to 80 years or more for larger dolphins such as orcas. Maui's dolphin (a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin) is the most endangered dolphin. There are less than 50 individuals remaining. Fewer than 10 vaquitas (a species of porpoise) survive. More amazing facts about dolphins The smallest dolphins New Zealand dolphin0 metres (female) Tucuxi0 metres (female) Vaquita0 metres (female) Which is the world's most endangered dolphin?The vaquita, which in Spanish means ‘little cow’, is the smallest porpoise in the world, and also the most endangered. The vaquita lives only in Mexican coastal waters, in a small area of the northern Gulf of California. The species is in terrible trouble and facing imminent extinction; there are only about 30 individuals left. Accidental capture and death in fishing nets is the cause of their rapid decline in numbers; to put it simply, more vaquitas are killed in fishing nets than are born each year. Maui's dolphin is also on the brink of extinction. Maui’s dolphin is a sub-species of the New Zealand dolphin that lives only in coastal waters of part of North Island, New Zealand. Maui’s dolphins are facing extinction; there are now less than 50 individuals left living along a 22-mile stretch of coastline. The problem causing this rapid decline and indeed the decline of Hector’s dolphin (the other New Zealand dolphin sub-species) in South Island is entanglement in fishing nets.

Dolphins can be found all over the world and in different environments There are 36 species of marine dolphins - living in nearly all aquatic environments, including oceans, coastal, estuarine and freshwater - and in temperatures ranging from less than 0°C to more than 30°C. In Britain, bottlenose dolphins are concentrated around west Wales and eastern Scotland - with the coasts of Devon and Cornwall also having pods. Scotland is home to the most northerly pod of bottlenose dolphins in the world. © Shutterstock / COULANGES / WWF-Sweden 2. Freshwater dolphins The Amazon river is home to four species of river dolphin that are found nowhere else on Earth.  © F. Bassemayousse / WWF France 3. Underwater noise pollution is a real threat to dolphins Marine traffic around the British Isles is amongst the most intense of anywhere in the world. Noise pollution from naval activity, the oil and gas industry, seismic surveys and underwater construction can stress and injure cetaceans. It also severely interferes with their ability to communicate, reproduce, navigate and find prey - sometimes proving fatal.  © Chris Martin Bahr / WWF 4. They’re fast sprinters Bottlenose dolphins are usually fairly slow swimmers, travelling at about 2 mph. However they can reach speeds of over 30 mph for brief periods!  © Gustavo Ybarra / WWF 5. How do you eat a fish? Probably not the same as a bottlenose dolphin, that’s for sure! They swallow a fish head first so the fish's spines don't catch in their throat.  © naturepl.com / Chris & Monique Fallows / WWF 6. They like to blow bubbles When hunting dolphins produce bubbles to herd their prey to the surface. They sometimes also use a hunting technique called 'fish-whacking', where they use their tail to hit fish and so stun them - making them easier to catch.  7. Dolphins are chatty animals Dolphins have some of the most elaborate acoustic abilities in the animal kingdom. They make a variety of sounds including whistles, clicks, squawks, squeaks, moans, barks, groans and yelps.  © James W. Thorsell / WWF 8. They’re intelligent, like us Bottlenose dolphins are one of the few species, along with apes and humans, that have the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror. This is considered 'reflective' of their intelligence. Dolphins are also among the few animals that have been documented using tools. In Shark Bay in Western Australia, dolphins fit marine sponges over their beaks to protect them from sharp, harmful rocks as they forage for fish.  © Antonio Busiello / WWF-US 9. They can turn off half of their brain Bottlenose dolphins sleep with one half of their brain at a time, and keep one eye open. It's believed they do this to keep an eye out for their group - to make sure they stick together - and to look out for predators like sharks.  © Thomas Cristofoletti / WWF-UK 10. Fishing gear is a major threat to dolphins Bottlenose dolphins are often killed accidentally in gillnets, driftnets, purse seines, trawls, long-lines and on hook-and-line gear used in fisheries. In UK waters, bottlenose dolphins are one of the species most threatened by bycatch. WWF and its partners are working with fisheries across the world to test and encourage the use of sustainable fishing gear. One solution is attaching acoustic alarms, or 'pingers', to fishing nets alerts cetaceans to the presence of fishing gear helping them avoid it.  Watch our YouTube video about Dolphins"}

They’re intelligent, like us Bottlenose dolphins are one of the few species, along with apes and humans, that have the ability to recognise themselves in a mirror. This is considered 'reflective' of their intelligence. Dolphins are also among the few animals that have been documented using tools. In Shark Bay in Western Australia, dolphins fit marine sponges over their beaks to protect them from sharp, harmful rocks as they forage for fish. © Antonio Busiello / WWF-US 9. They can turn off half of their brain Bottlenose dolphins sleep with one half of their brain at a time, and keep one eye open. It's believed they do this to keep an eye out for their group - to make sure they stick together - and to look out for predators like sharks. © Thomas Cristofoletti / WWF-UK 10. Fishing gear is a major threat to dolphins Bottlenose dolphins are often killed accidentally in gillnets, driftnets, purse seines, trawls, long-lines and on hook-and-line gear used in fisheries. In UK waters, bottlenose dolphins are one of the species most threatened by bycatch. WWF and its partners are working with fisheries across the world to test and encourage the use of sustainable fishing gear. One solution is attaching acoustic alarms, or 'pingers', to fishing nets alerts cetaceans to the presence of fishing gear helping them avoid it. Watch our YouTube video about Dolphins.

This visually shows that the buffer has no real end and it can loop around the buffer. However, since memory is never physically created as a ring, a linear representation is generally used as is done below. In computer science, a circular buffer, circular queue, cyclic buffer or ring buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams. [1] There were early circular buffer implementations in hardware. [2][3] A 24-byte keyboard circular buffer. When the write pointer is about to reach the read pointer—because the microprocessor is not responding—the buffer stops recording keystrokes. On some computers a beep would be played.

Circular buffers use FIFO (first in, first out) logic. In the example, 1 & 2 were the first to enter the circular buffer, they are the first to be removed, leaving 3 inside of the buffer. If the buffer has 7 elements, then it is completely full: A property of the circular buffer is that when it is full and a subsequent write is performed, then it starts overwriting the oldest data. In the current example, two more elements — A & B — are added and they overwrite the 3 & 4: Alternatively, the routines that manage the buffer could prevent overwriting the data and return an error or raise an exception. Whether or not data is overwritten is up to the semantics of the buffer routines or the application using the circular buffer.

(If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed. ) In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO (first in, first out) buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO (last in, first out) buffer. Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead. In some situations, overwriting circular buffer can be used, e. g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer–consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e. g. , an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e. g. , the sound card) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.

            Finally, if two elements are now removed then what would be removed is not A & B, but 5 & 6 because 5 & 6 are now the oldest elements, yielding the buffer with: The useful property of a circular buffer is that it does not need to have its elements shuffled around when one is consumed. (If a non-circular buffer were used then it would be necessary to shift all elements when one is consumed. ) In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO (first in, first out) buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO (last in, first out) buffer. Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Should a maximum size be adopted for a queue, then a circular buffer is a completely ideal implementation; all queue operations are constant time. However, expanding a circular buffer requires shifting memory, which is comparatively costly. For arbitrarily expanding queues, a linked list approach may be preferred instead. In some situations, overwriting circular buffer can be used, e. g. in multimedia. If the buffer is used as the bounded buffer in the producer–consumer problem then it is probably desired for the producer (e. g. , an audio generator) to overwrite old data if the consumer (e. g. , the sound card) is unable to momentarily keep up. Also, the LZ77 family of lossless data compression algorithms operates on the assumption that strings seen more recently in a data stream are more likely to occur soon in the stream. Implementations store the most recent data in a circular buffer.

Whether or not data is overwritten is up to the semantics of the buffer routines or the application using the circular buffer.
